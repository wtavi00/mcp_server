### Prerequisites

- Python (version requirements can be found at: https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/server)
- GitHub account
- Alpaca API keys (with paper or live trading access)
- Claude for Desktop or another compatible MCP client


2. Create and activate a virtual environment and Install the required packages:

    **Option A: Using pip (traditional)**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv myvenv
    source myvenv/bin/activate  # On Windows: myvenv\Scripts\activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    **Option B: Using uv (modern, faster)**

    To use uv, you'll first need to install it. See the [official uv installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) for detailed installation instructions for your platform.
    ```bash
    uv venv myvenv
    source myvenv/bin/activate # On Windows: myvenv\Scripts\activate
    uv pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    **Note:** The virtual environment will use the Python version that was used to create it. If you run the command with Python 3.10 or newer, your virtual environment will also use Python 3.10+. If you want to confirm the version, you can run `python3 --version` after activating the virtual environment. 

## Project Structure

After cloning and activating the virtual environment, your directory structure should look like this:
```
mcp_server/                 ← This is the workspace folder (= project root)
├── alpaca_mcp_server.py    ← Script is directly in workspace root
├── .github/                ← VS Code settings (for VS Code users)
│ ├── core/                 ← Core utility modules
│ └── workflows/            ← GitHub Actions workflows
├── .vscode/                ← VS Code settings (for VS Code users)
│   └── mcp.json
├── venv/                   ← Virtual environment folder
│   └── bin/python
├── .env.example            ← Environment template (use this to create `.env` file)
├── .gitignore              
├── Dockerfile              ← Docker configuration (for Docker use)
├── .dockerignore           ← Docker ignore (for Docker use)

└── README.md
```
### Create and edit a .env file for your credentials in the project directory

1. Copy the example environment file in the project root by running this command:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Replace the credentials (e.g. API keys) in the `.env` file:

   ```
   ALPACA_API_KEY = "your_alpaca_api_key_for_paper_account"
   ALPACA_SECRET_KEY = "your_alpaca_secret_key_for_paper_account"
   ALPACA_PAPER_TRADE = True
   TRADE_API_URL = None
   TRDE_API_WSS = None
   DATA_API_URL = None
   STREAM_DATA_WSS = None
   ```
   
### Start the MCP Server

Open a terminal in the project root directory and run the following command:

**For local usage (default - stdio transport):**
```bash
python alpaca_mcp_server.py
```

**For remote usage (HTTP transport):**
```bash
python alpaca_mcp_server.py --transport http
```

**Available transport options:**
- `--transport stdio` (default): Standard input/output for local client connections
- `--transport http`: HTTP transport for remote client connections (default: 127.0.0.1:8000)
- `--transport sse`: Server-Sent Events transport for remote connections (deprecated)
- `--host HOST`: Host to bind the server to for HTTP/SSE transport (default: 127.0.0.1)
- `--port PORT`: Port to bind the server to for HTTP/SSE transport (default: 8000)

**Note:** For more information about MCP transport methods, see the [official MCP transport documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/transports).

## Claude Desktop Usage

To use Alpaca MCP Server with Claude Desktop, please follow the steps below. The official Claude Desktop setup document is available here: https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user

### Configure Claude Desktop

1. Open Claude Desktop
2. Navigate to: `Settings → Developer → Edit Config`
3. Update your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

  **Note:**\
    Replace <project_root> with the path to your cloned alpaca-mcp-server directory. This should point to the Python executable inside the virtual environment you created with `python3 -m venv venv` in the terminal.

**For local usage (stdio transport - recommended):**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "alpaca": {
      "command": "<project_root>/venv/bin/python",
      "args": [
        "/path/to/alpaca-mcp-server/alpaca_mcp_server.py"
      ],
      "env": {
        "ALPACA_API_KEY": "your_alpaca_api_key_for_paper_account",
        "ALPACA_SECRET_KEY": "your_alpaca_secret_key_for_paper_account"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**For remote usage (HTTP transport):**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "alpaca": {
      "transport": "http",
      "url": "http://your-server-ip:8000/mcp",
      "env": {
        "ALPACA_API_KEY": "your_alpaca_api_key_for_paper_account",
        "ALPACA_SECRET_KEY": "your_alpaca_secret_key_for_paper_account"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Claude Code Usage

To use Alpaca MCP Server with Claude Code, please follow the steps below.

The `claude mcp add command` is part of [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code). If you have the Claude MCP CLI tool installed (e.g. by `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`), you can use this command to add the server to Claude Code:

```bash
claude mcp add alpaca \
  /path/to/your/alpaca-mcp-server/venv/bin/python \
  /path/to/your/alpaca-mcp-server/alpaca_mcp_server.py \
  -e ALPACA_API_KEY=your_api_key \
  -e ALPACA_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
```

**Note:** Replace the paths with your actual project directory paths. This command automatically adds the MCP server configuration to Claude Code without manual JSON editing.

The Claude MCP CLI tool needs to be installed separately. Check following the official pages for availability and installation instructions
* [Learn how to set up MCP with Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/mcp)
* [Install, authenticate, and start using Claude Code on your development machine](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/setup)


## Cursor Usage

To use Alpaca MCP Server with Cursor, please follow the steps below. The official Cursor MCP setup document is available here: https://docs.cursor.com/context/mcp

**Prerequisites**
- Cursor IDE installed with Claude AI enabled
- Python and virtual environment set up (follow Installation steps above)

### Configure the MCP Server

**Method 1: Using JSON Configuration**

Create or edit `~/.cursor/mcp.json` (macOS/Linux) or `%USERPROFILE%\.cursor\mcp.json` (Windows):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "alpaca": {
      "command": "/path/to/your/alpaca-mcp-server/venv/bin/python",
      "args": [
        "/path/to/your/alpaca-mcp-server/alpaca_mcp_server.py"
      ],
      "env": {
        "ALPACA_API_KEY": "your_alpaca_api_key",
        "ALPACA_SECRET_KEY": "your_alpaca_secret_key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Method 2: Using Cursor Settings UI**

1. Open Cursor Settings → **Tools & Integrations** → **MCP Tools**
2. Click **"+ New MCP Server"**
3. Configure with the same details as the JSON method above

**Note:** Replace the paths with your actual project directory paths and API credentials.

## VS Code Usage

To use Alpaca MCP Server with VS Code, please follow the steps below.

VS Code supports MCP servers through GitHub Copilot's agent mode.
The official VS Code setup document is available here: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers

**Prerequisites**
- VS Code with GitHub Copilot extension installed and active subscription
- Python and virtual environment set up (follow Installation steps above)
- MCP support enabled in VS Code (see below)

### 1. Enable MCP Support in VS Code

1. Open VS Code Settings (Ctrl/Cmd + ,)
2. Search for "chat.mcp.enabled" to check the box to enable MCP support
3. Search for "github.copilot.chat.experimental.mcp" to check the box to use instruction files

### 2. Configure the MCP Server

**Recommendation:** Use **workspace-specific** configuration (`.vscode/mcp.json`) instead of user-wide configuration. This allows different projects to use different API keys (multiple paper accounts or live trading) and keeps trading tools isolated from other development work.

**For workspace-specific settings:**

1. Create `.vscode/mcp.json` in your project root.
2. Add the Alpaca MCP server configuration manually to the mcp.json file:

    For Linux/macOS:
    ```json
    {
      "mcp": {
        "servers": {
          "alpaca": {
            "type": "stdio",
            "command": "bash",
            "args": ["-c", "cd ${workspaceFolder} && source ./venv/bin/activate && python alpaca_mcp_server.py"],
            "env": {
              "ALPACA_API_KEY": "your_alpaca_api_key",
              "ALPACA_SECRET_KEY": "your_alpaca_secret_key"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    For Windows:
    ```json
    {
      "mcp": {
        "servers": {
          "alpaca": {
            "type": "stdio", 
            "command": "cmd",
            "args": ["/c", "cd /d ${workspaceFolder} && .\\venv\\Scripts\\activate && python alpaca_mcp_server.py"],
            "env": {
              "ALPACA_API_KEY": "your_alpaca_api_key",
              "ALPACA_SECRET_KEY": "your_alpaca_secret_key"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    **Note:** Replace `${workspaceFolder}` with your actual project path. For example:
      - Linux/macOS: `/Users/username/Documents/alpaca-mcp-server`
      - Windows: `C:\\Users\\username\\Documents\\alpaca-mcp-server`
   
**For user-wide settings:**

To configure an MCP server for all your workspaces, you can add the server configuration to your user settings.json file. This allows you to reuse the same server configuration across multiple projects.
Specify the server in the `mcp` VS Code user settings (`settings.json`) to enable the MCP server across all workspaces.
```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "alpaca": {
        "type": "stdio",
        "command": "bash",
        "args": ["-c", "cd ${workspaceFolder} && source ./venv/bin/activate && python alpaca_mcp_server.py"],
        "env": {
          "ALPACA_API_KEY": "your_alpaca_api_key",
          "ALPACA_SECRET_KEY": "your_alpaca_secret_key"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## PyCharm Usage

To use the Alpaca MCP Server with PyCharm, please follow the steps below. The official setup guide for configuring the MCP Server in PyCharm is available here: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/ai-assistant/configure-an-mcp-server.html

PyCharm supports MCP servers through its integrated MCP client functionality. This configuration ensures proper logging behavior and prevents common startup issues.

1. **Open PyCharm Settings**
   - Go to `File → Settings`
   - Navigate to `Tools → Model Context Protocol (MCP)` (or similar location depending on PyCharm version)

2. **Add New MCP Server**
   - Click `Add` or `+` to create a new server configuration. You can also import the settings from Claude by clicking the corresponding button.
   - **Name**: Enter any name you prefer for this server configuration (e.g., Alpaca MCP).
   - **Command**: "/path/to/your/alpaca-mcp-server/venv/bin/python"
   - **Arguments**: "alpaca_mcp_server.py"
   - **Working directory**: "/path/to/your/alpaca-mcp-server"

3. **Set Environment Variables**
   Add the following environment variables in the Environment Variables parameter:
   ```
   ALPACA_API_KEY="your_alpaca_api_key"
   ALPACA_SECRET_KEY="your_alpaca_secret_key"
   MCP_CLIENT=pycharm
   ```

## Docker Usage

To use Alpaca MCP Server with Docker, please follow the steps below.

**Prerequisite:**  
You must have [Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) on your system.

### Run the latest published image (recommended for most users)
```bash
docker run -it --rm \
  -e ALPACA_API_KEY=your_alpaca_api_key \
  -e ALPACA_SECRET_KEY=your_alpaca_secret_key \
  ghcr.io/chand1012/alpaca-mcp-server:latest
```   

This pulls and runs the latest published version of the server. Replace `your_alpaca_api_key` and `your_alpaca_secret_key` with your actual keys. If the server exposes a port (e.g., 8080), add `-p 8080:8080` to the command.

### Build and run locally (for development or custom changes)
```bash
docker build -t alpaca-mcp-server .
docker run -it --rm \
  -e ALPACA_API_KEY=your_alpaca_api_key \
  -e ALPACA_SECRET_KEY=your_alpaca_secret_key \
  alpaca-mcp-server
```
Use this if you want to run a modified or development version of the server.

### Using with Claude Desktop
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "alpaca": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "-e", "ALPACA_API_KEY",
        "-e", "ALPACA_SECRET_KEY",
        "ghcr.io/chand1012/alpaca-mcp-server:latest"
      ],
      "env": {
        "ALPACA_API_KEY": "your_alpaca_api_key",
        "ALPACA_SECRET_KEY": "your_alpaca_secret_key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Environment variables can be set either with `-e` flags or in the `"env"` object, but not both. For Claude Desktop, use the `"env"` object.

**Security Note:**  Never share your API keys or commit them to public repositories. Be cautious when passing secrets as environment variables, especially in shared or production environments.

**For more advanced Docker usage:**  See the [official Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/).

## 4. API Key Configuration for Live Trading

This MCP server connects to Alpaca's **paper trading API** by default for safe testing.
To enable **live trading with real funds**, update the following configuration files:

### Set Your API Credentials in Two Places:

1. **Update environment file in the project directory**

    Provide your live account keys as environment variables in the `.env` file:
    ```
    ALPACA_API_KEY = "your_alpaca_api_key_for_live_account"
    ALPACA_SECRET_KEY = "your_alpaca_secret_key_for_live_account"
    ALPACA_PAPER_TRADE = False
    TRADE_API_URL = None
    TRADE_API_WSS = None
    DATA_API_URL = None
    STREAM_DATA_WSS = None
    ```
    
2. **Update Configuration file**

   For example, when using Claude Desktop, provide your live account keys as environment variables in `claude_desktop_config.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "alpaca": {
         "command": "<project_root>/venv/bin/python",
         "args": [
           "/path/to/alpaca_mcp_server.py"
         ],
         "env": {
           "ALPACA_API_KEY": "your_alpaca_api_key_for_live_account",
           "ALPACA_SECRET_KEY": "your_alpaca_secret_key_for_live_account"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

## HTTP Transport for Remote Usage

For users who need to run the MCP server on a remote machine (e.g., Ubuntu server) and connect from a different machine (e.g., Windows Claude Desktop), use HTTP transport:

### Server Setup (Remote Machine)
```bash
# Start server with HTTP transport (default: 127.0.0.1:8000)
python alpaca_mcp_server.py --transport http

# Start server with custom host/port for remote access
python alpaca_mcp_server.py --transport http --host 0.0.0.0 --port 9000

# For systemd service (example from GitHub issue #6)
# Update your start script to use HTTP transport
#!/bin/bash
cd /root/alpaca-mcp-server
source venv/bin/activate
exec python3 -u alpaca_mcp_server.py --transport http --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

**Remote Access Options:**
1. **Direct binding**: Use `--host 0.0.0.0` to bind to all interfaces for direct remote access
2. **SSH tunneling**: `ssh -L 8000:localhost:8000 user@your-server` for secure access (recommended for localhost binding)
3. **Reverse proxy**: Use nginx/Apache to expose the service securely with authentication

### Client Setup
Update your Claude Desktop configuration to use HTTP:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "alpaca": {
      "transport": "http",
      "url": "http://your-server-ip:8000/mcp",
      "env": {
        "ALPACA_API_KEY": "your_alpaca_api_key",
        "ALPACA_SECRET_KEY": "your_alpaca_secret_key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Troubleshooting HTTP Transport Issues
- **Port not listening**: Ensure the server started successfully and check firewall settings
- **Connection refused**: Verify the server is running on the expected host:port
- **ENOENT errors**: Make sure you're using the updated server command with `--transport http`
- **Remote access**: Use `--host 0.0.0.0` for direct access, or SSH tunneling for localhost binding
- **Port conflicts**: Use `--port <PORT>` to specify a different port if default is busy

## Security Notice

This server can place real trades and access your portfolio. Treat your API keys as sensitive credentials. Review all actions proposed by the LLM carefully, especially for complex options strategies or multi-leg trades.

**HTTP Transport Security**: When using HTTP transport, the server defaults to localhost (127.0.0.1:8000) for security. For remote access, you can bind to all interfaces with `--host 0.0.0.0`, use SSH tunneling (`ssh -L 8000:localhost:8000 user@server`), or set up a reverse proxy with authentication for secure access.

## Usage Analytics Notice

The user agent for API calls defaults to 'ALPACA-MCP-SERVER' to help Alpaca identify MCP server usage and improve user experience. You can opt out by modifying the 'USER_AGENT' constant in '.github/core/user_agent_mixin.py' or by removing the 'UserAgentMixin' from the client class definitions in 'alpaca_mcp_server.py' — though we kindly hope you'll keep it enabled to support ongoing improvements.
